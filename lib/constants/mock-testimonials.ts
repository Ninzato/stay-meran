      "Dorothea's house is beautiful and clean, original and very well-kept in every detail, the villa where it is charming and surrounded by greenery, the neighborhood is quiet and feels like walking in a forest but at the same time it is very close to the center and the magnificent paths and gardens of Merano. The owners are attentive, thoughtful, and kind! A great stay!"
